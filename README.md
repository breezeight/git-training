Git Training
============

Does this look familiar? NO

Sadly it's not that far from the truth for many users of Git,
and doesn't always improve with more exposure.

One analogy could be made with the following comic.

In this case each blind man could represent a different Git command.
By just running the commands, there are a number of cases where
what you _think_ Git is doing is not what it's _actually_ doing.

In particular this often involves commands relating to branches,
and pushing/pulling from a remote server.

This material is _not_ intended to teach advanced Git
(eg. run `git magic --hard --all` and you'll be more 100x more productive).
The aim is to focus on a few critical aspects of Git that can often cause
the most amount of confusion.


Prerequisites
-------------

Everything in this guide assumes some form of terminal/command-line with `git` installed.

For Windows this means [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win),
ideally in the `msysgit` terminal and not Windows `Cmd`.
If you're not sure try running `ls`, `cd` or `cat README.md`, the
examples make some use of these commands.

No GUIs.
